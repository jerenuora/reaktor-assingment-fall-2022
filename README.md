# reaktor-assingment-fall-2022


## The app is up and running at: <https://shielded-sierra-25818.herokuapp.com/>

My submission for the Reaktor fall 2022 Software Development Trainee pre-assingment application. 

Due to the small size of the app, I opted to use a single page app with no dedicated backend, instead parsing the .lock-file in the browser. The file is currently very crudely hardcoded in the app in the form raw.githubusercontent.com -url.
